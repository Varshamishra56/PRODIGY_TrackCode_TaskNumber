# Cats and Dogs Image Classification using SVM

This project demonstrates the use of Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classifying images of cats and dogs. The dataset used is the popular "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset from Kaggle. The images are preprocessed using the MobileNetV2 model to extract features, which are then fed into an SVM for classification.

## Dataset

The dataset can be found on Kaggle and consists of two zip files:
- `train.zip`: Contains the training images of cats and dogs.
- `test1.zip`: Contains the test images of cats and dogs.
- `sampleSubmission.csv`: Sample submission file for Kaggle competition.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies:
- `tensorflow`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `sklearn`
- `pandas`
- `tqdm`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib sklearn pandas tqdm
